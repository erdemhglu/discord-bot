# Flows (event → what happens, step by step)

## A message arrives
0. Every message (the bot's own included, via `send`) lands in the channel's history:
   `channel_note` → memory (60 lines) + `durum/kanallar/<id>.md`. When a new chat opens, the
   last 10 lines become its seed (`start_chat`), so context isn't lost even if the chat has
   ended or the bot restarted.
0. **Commands never enter this flow.** The bot is managed only through slash (`/`) commands;
   `Handler::message` no longer parses text as a command, every message goes straight into the
   steps below. Slash commands have a separate flow: Discord sends `Interaction::Command`,
   `interaction_create` (main.rs) looks the name up in the `command::definitions()` table and
   calls the matching handler — see the "Slash commands" section.
1. `Handler::message`: returns for bot/webhook/DM; returns for a guild/channel outside
   `GUILD_ID`/`CHANNELS` when those are set. `content_safe` (mentions become `@name`,
   `@everyone` is neutralized).
1b. **Image attachment:** the URL of the first attachment in `msg.attachments` whose
    `content_type` starts with `image/` is taken. The early-return condition is now "neither
    text nor an attachment", not "text is empty": a message that's only an image still gets
    processed. The text going to memory/channel note/chat line is marked: `[resim] <text>` if
    there's text, `[resim attı]` if not. The URL only goes into the chat history's
    `ChatMessage.image` field and stays **only on the latest user message** (adding a new line
    sets earlier entries' `image` to `None`: a discord cdn link has a short lifetime, and
    resending an old image every turn burns tokens). If `message_json` sees this field, the
    request body's `content` becomes a `[{text},{image_url}]` array instead of plain text (same
    shape as agents.rs's `image_commenter`).
2. Under lock: was it tagged? (mention list ∪ the replied-to message is the bot's ∪ the bot's
   name appears in the text)
3. `remember` (raw memory), `last_channel`, favorite's name.
4. If it posted news and 2 hours have passed, close that chat silently (no ban).
5. **If asleep:** if tagged, queue it (≤20), no reply, return.
6. If tagged, or it's an **ongoing dialog** (a chat is open AND the sender of that chat's last
   user message is the same person who sent this one — genuinely talking to them), reply
   directly. Otherwise (no chat, or SOMEONE ELSE wrote in the channel), a **willingness
   evaluation**: at most once every 2 minutes per channel, a mini model call (`isteklilik.md`,
   ~80 tokens) produces `{"puan":0-10}` from the last 12 messages + profile + index; joins the
   chat if above the threshold (`WILLINGNESS_THRESHOLD`, ±1 by stage confidence, +2 while
   traveling). A fallback dice roll (`CHANCE`) if the call fails. This prevents auto-replying to
   EVERYONE in an already-open chat's channel — only to its actual counterpart.
7. If a chat is open, add the user line to history (last 20).
8. Outside the lock: `reply`.

## A reaction was added
`Handler::reaction_add` (needs the `GUILD_MESSAGE_REACTIONS` intent) fires on every reaction,
but only cares about ones on the **bot's own message**, from a human, in a guild (not a DM), and
passing the `GUILD_ID`/`CHANNELS` filter — everything else returns immediately. The `Reaction`
event carries neither who reacted nor the reacted-to message's text: both are fetched over HTTP
via `add_reaction.user`/`.message`. A reaction on a message with empty text (embed-only) is
skipped — a reaction to a card/status line doesn't count as "to the bot's own words".
`reaction_label` makes the emoji readable: unicode as-is, a custom guild emoji as `:name:` (not
Discord's raw `<:name:id>` mention form). The result lands as a
`"(tepki 💀) \"...\" mesajına tepki verdi"` line in `remember` (raw memory) and `channel_note`;
if a chat is open in that channel it's added to `chat.history` too (the model sees this as
context in its next reply). **It never triggers a reply on its own** — no willingness
evaluation, no new message goes out; the bot only notices, and may bring it up in its next
natural reply. Logged as `tepki: <name> → <emoji>` if `debug` is on.

## Output protocol (every reply with personality goes through this)
The model writes not plain text but a **line-based protocol**; `parse_reply` decodes it
(on text that already had `strip_name` applied, no re-stripping):
- **Every line is its own discord message.** Blank lines are dropped, at most `BURST_LIMIT` (4)
  lines go out; the rest are dropped (debug log). A line over 1900 characters is split within
  itself by `split`.
- **A `tepki: 💀` line does NOT go out as text**, it becomes a reaction emoji on the message
  being replied to. Case and "tepki :" spacing are tolerated; the first emoji run after the
  colon is taken (letters, whitespace, and one character from a known emoji block — U+2600–27BF,
  U+2B00–2BFF, U+1F000–1FAFF, singles like ©/®/™ — plus a trailing variation
  selector/ZWJ/keycap, up to 8 chars). The definition is deliberately narrow: `—`, `…`, `→`,
  and typographic quotes are not emoji, Discord returns a 400 for those. A custom `:kekw:`-style
  emoji, and a line with no emoji at all, are silently dropped. The first reaction wins.
- **Silence:** a line that's just `-` (or `"-"`, `'-'`, `[sus]`, `(sus)`) sets the `silent` flag
  and doesn't go out as a line. Nothing is sent only if `silent` is set alone.
- **Stray bits and slop:** a line starting with `'` (the continuation of a previous message) is
  dropped; `clean_slop` strips a leading `- `/`* `/`• ` bullet and `**`/`__` marks (the
  backtick itself and its CONTENTS are preserved: `` `__init__` `` isn't mangled). A `1. `/`2) `
  number prefix is stripped only when the reply has **≥2 numbered lines** (a real list) — a
  single line like "3. sınıftayım" is a Turkish ordinal. A line identical to one already seen
  this turn doesn't go out a second time. **A short line is never filtered out**: "he", "yok",
  "la" are natural reactions.
- The form that lands in history and the channel note is `Reply::protocol_text()`: lines joined
  by `\n`, with `tepki: 💀` at the end if present. So the model sees its own format again next
  turn.

## reply (one chat turn, streaming)
```
lock ── busy? exit ── chat exists? ── pick instruction ── busy=1 ── release lock
wait 0.15-0.35s ── fresh history + last message + pending arrivals ── mood (every 4 turns) ── research(link/news/lookup) ── target selection (if 2+ people wrote) ── question cap (too_many_questions) ── typing…
generate_stream(stream, budget: reply_budget!) ── (error: busy=0, exit)
send_stream: the message opens on the first MEANINGFUL content (as long as the layout is still empty, "first" isn't spent; stream_slice holds back a short partial line) ── edited every STREAM_EDIT_INTERVAL (1.2s) ── while thinking (answer hasn't started): show="Düşünüyorum...", hide=live word counter, silent/off=nothing (the message never opens until the answer starts) ── once the answer starts, the same message is edited as it streams ── show: thinking is one newline-less line, both a spoiler and a code block ── hide: thinking isn't in the message, a "Düşünce Sürecini Göster" button appears at the end of the answer (interaction_create opens an ephemeral code block for whoever clicks it, thought storage holds 50 messages) ── silent: reasoning is requested (runs in the background) but never collected/shown, no button either ── off: the request carries no reasoning ── the discord reply attaches only to the first message
the part shown WHILE streaming: finished lines (followed by \n) + the last partial line, but only once it passes HALF_LINE_THRESHOLD (12) characters (stream_slice) ── so a half-formed "tep" doesn't become a message that then gets deleted
once streaming ENDS, parse_reply:
  silent ∧ no line ∧ NO REACTION EITHER → the temporary messages opened are deleted, StreamResult::Silent (nothing enters history, the counter doesn't advance, last_activity isn't refreshed, the fallback generate is NOT called; hacked still decrements) ── if "-" and "tepki: 💀" arrive together it's not silence, the emoji still lands
  nothing at all → StreamResult::Empty → non-streaming fallback generate + line-based repeat filtering + send_reply
  is_repeat is LINE-BASED: lines identical to one of the last 5 bot lines are dropped; if no line is left and there's no reaction either, regenerate once, and if that repeats too (or the new reply has neither a line nor a reaction), delete what was opened and Empty
  the final layout is written with write_stream (extra messages are deleted) ── if there's a reaction, create_reaction on context.reaction_target's message (error is a warn log, the stream doesn't stop; a reaction alone is still a valid reply)
if 2+ different people wrote in a row, a TARGET_PICK mini call picks the target person; the reply is linked to their message, and "address them" is noted in the instruction
if a new message arrives during generation, the stream still finishes (no starting over); the new message is handled on the next turn
lock ── busy=0 ── every visible line goes into own_messages one at a time, all of them into channel_notes with a SINGLE file write (the reaction as a "bot: tepki: 💀" line) ── the assistant line = protocol_text ── counter++ ── hacked-- ── release lock
… exit if no new message, otherwise loop again
```
Instruction priority: hack continuing > hack exiting > empty. Added on top: mood, an internet
finding, a target-person note, the question cap.

## Question cap
`too_many_questions(state, channel)`: if ≥2 of the channel history's last 4 bot lines (`tepki:`
lines don't count) end in `?`, "Bu sefer soru sorma; düz laf et ya da sus." is added to the
instruction. Code measures, the model enforces — no cutting/trimming. Both `reply` and the CLI
chat mode apply it.

## send_lines (the non-streaming paths)
`strip_name` + `parse_reply` → `send_reply` (the body; paths already holding a resolved `Reply`
call it directly) → lines go out one at a time as separate messages. Between them,
`300 ms + 15 ms × character` (capped at 1500 ms) of delay plus `broadcast_typing` — none of the
stream's own pacing applies here, so three messages don't all land at once. The discord reply
attaches only to the first line; the ping too, but **only after the protocol is decoded**,
prepended as `<@id> ` to the first line's front at send time — pasting it in beforehand made `-`
and `tepki:` lines unrecognizable. A reaction is sent and written to the channel note in
protocol form if a target was given; **without a target, the reaction is dropped** (so a
reaction that wouldn't be visible in the channel isn't counted as "sent"). **Nothing is sent**
for `silent`, or for a reply with nothing left to send; `None` is returned — the opening senders
(poke, sorun, news teaser, welcome, woke up, waking reply, on the road, leaving, name
announcement) skip that turn, no chat opens. The `protocol_text` it returns becomes the chat's
opening seed text. `run_prank` sends the image and text in a single message, so it keeps only
the protocol's first line.

## Chat lifecycle
- Opening sources: random drop-in, a tag, welcome, news sharing, poke, prank, waking up, a
  message from the road, a leaving announcement. Ones with an opening start with `counter=1`.
- No message limit and no farewell: a chat closes silently 30 minutes after the last message
  (`close_timed_out` on the minute tick), no channel ban. A closed chat's transcript goes to the
  diarist and the critic.
- The ban only blocks *dropping in* — a tag always gets a reply.
- If the model call errors, the counter doesn't advance and the chat stays open.

## generate (every call with personality)
1. `name` (before ": ") and text are parsed out of the `user` lines in history.
2. `memory::keywords(texts)` → ≤40 words.
3. Locked: `memory::retrieve(participants, name_to_id, keywords, raw memory, 20)` → the
   budgeted context; `system_text`.
4. `ask` → `clean` (name prefix, quotes, 1900).
Chat replies don't use this; `generate_stream` builds the same system and opens a stream
(`send_stream` writes it), with no cutting.

## CLI chat (`cargo run -- chat`)
A terminal rig for trying out the protocol without ever connecting to Discord
(`src/chat_cli.rs`).
```
main: is the first argument "chat"? → Bot::setup() (DOESN'T NEED DISCORD_TOKEN, only a model key)
  no key → "chat mode failed to start: <reason>" + exit code 1
bot_name empty (ready never fires here) → growth.name, then "bot"
start_chat(ChannelId::new(1)) — seeded from the real durum/ files, personality stays realistic
loop: a stdin line "name: text" (no colon, or either side empty → sender is "misafir") · !quit or EOF → exit
  remember + channel history (IN MEMORY ONLY, append_history) + a user line added to chat history
  question-cap instruction ── generate (NO streaming) ── strip_name ── parse_reply
  output: each line as "bot_name: line" · reaction as "[reaction 💀]" · silence as "(silent)" · nothing as "(empty)" · a model error as "(error: …)" and the loop continues
  protocol_text appended to history, counter++
```
Nothing is written to the actual state: `channel_note` is replaced with the in-memory
`append_history`, and neither the agents nor the cycles ever run in this mode. (One exception:
since `Bot::setup()` is shared with the live path, it still creates the empty
`durum/{kisiler,konular,olaylar,arsiv,kanallar}` and `photos/` folders.) **Unverified:** there's
no real model key on this machine, live back-and-forth has never been observed (see AGENTS.md
"Known gaps").

## Slash commands (command handler → embed → detail modal)
`ready` → registers with every guild (`modal::register_commands`, idempotent): the list is
derived from the `command::definitions()` table (name/description/options in one source, never
hand-kept in two places) → the user runs the slash command → `interaction_create(Command)` →
looked up by `cmd.data.name` in the table, the matching handler is called. Every command returns
an **embed**, never plain text:
- Local/fast commands (`durum, yardim, ayarlar, zihin` default view, `sifirla, dusunme, model`
  query, `debug`) reply directly with `CreateInteractionResponse::Message`
  (`send_response`/`reply_info`, embed via `modal::info_embed`).
- Commands that make a network/model call (`haber, sorun, gez, saka, hack, ajanlar, uyan, uyu,
  zihin test:true, model id change`) could exceed Discord's 3-second initial-reply limit, so they
  acknowledge instantly with `defer` (`Defer`), then write a short result embed with
  `report_result` (`edit_response`) once the work is done — the actual content (news/joke/etc.)
  already went to the channel via its own `Bot::send` call, this is just an "OK" note.

`/zihin` card: three columns (People/Topics/Events) + a person select menu at the top,
Topics/Events/Bot-summary buttons at the bottom.
Picking a person from the menu or pressing a button → `interaction_create(Component)` → the
matching **detail modal** (`person_modal` / `topics_modal` / `events_modal` / `summary_modal`);
each section in its own labeled field, nothing dumped into one box.
If the user submits the modal → `interaction_create(Modal)` → a brief ephemeral confirmation; no
input is collected.
`/zihin test:true` replaces the old panel-diagnostic path (see "Mind chain" below).

## On connecting to a guild
`guild_create` (once per guild) → in the background: a 14-day backfill scan (permitted
channels, pages of 100) → the last 2000 lines of raw memory → profiler → coach (if temperament
is empty). Not re-scanned on a reconnect.
`guild_create` also sends a one-line version announcement to the default channel, once per
process (`Handler.announced`): `geldim · v1.0.0 (69e2851, 2026-09-02) · model … · düşünme …` —
this doesn't get written to memory or the channel note (so the bot doesn't mistake it for its
own words). Not in `ready`, because the guild cache isn't populated yet at that point.

## The 6-hour round (news_cycle)
not awake → skip · traveling → profiler, coach, skip · profiler → diarist("observation", last
300) → coach → skip if a chat is already open in the channel → news_agent (HN 12 + Sözcü 12, not
yet posted) → selection → teaser (`generate`) → send → open a chat, wait 2 hours for comments,
mark the news as "posted".

## Poke (hourly)
25% (`PROBLEM_SHARE`): `post_problem` to the default channel (a made-up code problem + a
question), a chat opens. Otherwise, the flow below.
not awake → skip · traveling: skip if it already wrote today, 25% → `ON_THE_WAY` · travels
tomorrow: `LEAVING` once · otherwise 30% → `OUT_OF_THE_BLUE` · skip if no `idle_channel` →
`generate(last 40 lines)` → send → open a chat.

## Prank (every 3 hours, 10%)
awake ∧ not traveling ∧ an idle channel ∧ `photos/` isn't empty → 30% hack (`HACK_ENTER` text +
image, chat `hacked=3`: 2 turns of `HACK_CONTINUE`, 1 turn of `HACK_EXIT`) · 70% a plain image
(`image_commenter`: the model actually looks at the image).

## Agenda wandering (10 min after startup, then every 4 hours)
rss first 20 → pick (`WANDERER_PICK`, temperament+profile) → up to 3 pages (`read_page`:
firecrawl or plain) → `generate(WANDERER_NOTE)`, the bot's own journal entry → `gundem.md` (12
entries, the oldest goes to the archive) → `State.agenda` = last 3 → the "GÜNDEM" section of
every reply, and coach's input.

## Sleep (every minute)
`/uyan`: `forced_awake_until` runs until the current plan's end (deleting the plan doesn't work
— it gets rebuilt a minute later and puts the bot back to sleep). `/uyu [hour]`: a temporary
plan, the forced flag is reset.
`update`: if there's no plan for yesterday+today, build one (20% if tense, 7% otherwise, for a
sleepless night). The awake→asleep / asleep→awake transition is logged. Being asleep never
enters the chat prompt as an in-character excuse.
**Listening continues while asleep:** messages still go into raw memory; `memory_cycle` runs a
night observation into the mind every 2 hours; the news round picks news while asleep but
doesn't post it, stashing it in `stashed_news`.
**On waking:** if there's a pending mention, a definite reply via `WOKE_UP` (put back on error,
never lost). With no mention, the `uyanis.md` agent evaluates the night's messages
(`{"ilgi":0-10,"konu"}`); if interest ≥5, a morning line via `uyanis-cevap.md` to the last
channel talked in. A stashed news item is posted as "morning news" on the first turn awake.

## Travel (from the calendar)
`travel::now()` looks today up in the table. Effects: the "ŞU AN" line, drop-in chance ×0.3, no
news/pranks, at most 1 message from the road a day instead of poke, `LEAVING` one day ahead. No
persisted state; only the `last_road_message` and `announced_trip` flags.

## Growth
Every finished chat is `growth.chats++`, every message is `growth.messages++`. `check_growth`:
the stage only ever advances (new → warming-up → settled-in → old-timer) based on day and chat
thresholds. Stage effects: the "GELİŞİM EVREN" section in the system message, drop-in chance ×
stage.confidence, poke × stage.poke. On entering the settled-in stage it picks a name once: the
model gives a single word, the nickname changes in every guild, it becomes `bot_name`, and it's
announced to the group. Counters live in `durum/gelisim.md`; a restart doesn't reset them.

## Finished chat → memory
A chat quiet for 30 minutes is closed by `close_timed_out`; the transcript lands in
`State.memory_queue`. `memory_cycle` (every 10 min, independent of sleep) processes the queue:
`diarist`'s JSON → an `olaylar/AA.md` line (with seconds), person files keyed by id (names
resolved via `name_to_id`; score, note, facts, tags, events), topic files, `kendim.md`,
`INDEX.md` → `summarizer` shrinks whatever's over the limit (archiving it) → `critic` also runs
for a finished chat → `duzeltmeler.md`. The 6-hour round's observation goes through the same
queue.

## Mind chain (chat → diarist) and diagnostics
`close_timed_out` → info log
`mind: chat closed [channel] (30 min quiet) → queued (n), diarist within 10 min`
→ `memory_cycle` (10 min) → `diarist` → info
`mind: diarist [source]: k person(s), m topic(s), o event(s) written`
or warn `mind: diarist failed [source]: <reason>`. `diarist` now returns
`Result<DiaristSummary, BotError>`.
`/zihin test:true`: hands the channel's last 30 lines straight to the diarist, writes the result
as a single message (without the 40-minute wait).
On a reasoning-mandatory model (glm-5.3-flash), `ask_raw`: a 400 "mandatory" → the fields are
stripped + `reasoning.effort=low` on openrouter + the budget raised to max(2×, 1500); a 200 with
empty content → for JSON-expecting categories (gunlukcu, isteklilik, hedef_sec, ruh_hali,
uyanis) the `{…}` content inside the thought field is counted instead (warn log), not counted
for a plain-prose call; if it's still empty the budget is grown and it's retried once more; the
error message includes category/model/budget/thought length.

## Debug mode (`/debug`, settings panel)
While `State.debug` is on, `debug_note` writes a single line (⚙ …, ≤300 chars) to
DEBUG_CHANNEL, or to the message's own channel if there is none, and info-logs it; it never
enters memory or the channel note. Traces (in English, for developer diagnosis): the message
decision (`tag` / `dialog ongoing` / `willingness p/threshold · reason: … → reply|silent` /
`2min limit` / `fallback die`), the reply turn (`mood`, `target`, `question cap`, `n line(s)
sent · reaction X` / `silent (-)` / `stream empty → fallback generate`),
`sohbet kapandı (30 dk sessiz)`.

## Settings panel (`/ayarlar`)
An embed (version, model, thinking, debug, sleep, travel) + buttons: thinking
show/hide/silent/off (the active one is Primary), debug on/off, wake up / put to sleep (8
hours). Button → `interaction_create(Component)` `setting_*` → `Handler::setting_button`: the
same paths as the commands (`ThinkingMode` + dusunme.md, `set_debug`,
`wake`/`put_to_sleep` + `sleep_transition`) → the panel is refreshed in place with
`UpdateMessage`. The reply is ephemeral (visible only to whoever pressed it).
