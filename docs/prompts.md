# Prompts

All of them are `prompts/<lang>/<name>.md`; in `src/prompts.rs`: `mod tr { pub const CONST =
include_str!(...); }` — each language has its own submodule, all collected into a single
`Prompts` struct, and `prompts::current()` returns the right struct based on
`Lang::current()`, which is fixed for the life of the process (call sites are
`prompts::current().field_name` — see `src/lang.rs`, AGENTS.md item 12). The file's first
line, `# Title`, goes to the model too. Placeholders are filled in code via
`.replace("{x}", ..)`; an unfilled placeholder passes through as-is, so update the code too
when adding a new placeholder.
(File names and content under `prompts/` were deliberately left in Turkish — the bot's
personality, see AGENTS.md item 8. The Rust side below is in English. `tr/` and `en/` are
both filled in.)

Text shown on Discord (slash command name/description, embed, button, `/yardim`'s text)
lives in a separate system: `langs/<lang>.json` — a flat `{"key": "value"}`, read by
`src/strings.rs`'s `t(key)`. It's selected by the same `Lang::current()`, and the same
`{name}` placeholder rule applies. To see which key is used where, look at `langs/tr.json`
itself (on the code side, every `strings::t("...")` call shows which key it reads); no
separate table is kept.

## How a "task" goes out
`generate(history, instruction, n)` → `system_text(state, instruction, retrieved)` → the
last section of the system message is `ŞU ANKİ GÖREVİN\n<instruction>`. An empty instruction
skips the section. The active chat history is sent separately; server-wide raw messages are
not added to the system prompt as few-shot examples.

## Prompts that expect JSON
DIARIST, WILLINGNESS, TARGET_PICK, WAKING, MOOD. The code takes what's between `{…}` with
`extract_json`, and tolerates missing fields via `serde(default)`; if it can't be parsed
(DIARIST) "diarist: couldn't parse json" is logged and memory doesn't change; for mini calls
(e.g. MOOD) it silently falls back to `None`/a fallback behavior. (The JSON field names —
`puan`, `sebep`, `hedef`, `durum`, `yogunluk`, `olay`, `kisiler`, `isim`, etc. — are
deliberately Turkish: the model produces them under these names, and the Rust struct fields
have to match them, see AGENTS.md item 8.)

## Prompts that expect a number
NEWS_PICK (single number), WANDERER_PICK (comma-separated). The code discards anything that
isn't a digit; if out of range, 0 / empty.

## The prompt that describes the output protocol
`kisilik.md`'s `## NASIL YAZARSIN` section teaches the model the protocol; its counterpart
on the code side is `parse_reply` (see docs/flows.md "Output protocol"). The two change
together:
- every LINE is a separate message (usually a single line; two sometimes, three rarely,
  four never — the ceiling in code is `BURST_LIMIT=4`), neutral/informational remarks aren't
  split, splitting is an emotional signal
- a single `-` line if there's nothing to say (code: `silence_marker` → nothing is sent)
- a `tepki: 💀` line is an emoji reaction instead of text (code: `reaction_body` +
  `extract_emoji`)
- no bullet points/numbering/bold text/paragraphs (the code also strips these via
  `clean_slop`)
- if an image is posted it sees it, doesn't describe it (code: `message_json`'s image
  block)
- no back-to-back questions (code: the `too_many_questions` instruction)

`elestirmen.md`'s "what to check" list also audits this protocol: did it reply
unnecessarily / did it talk where it should have stayed silent (`-`), did it use reactions
appropriately, did it split lines naturally.
`kisilik.md` has no list of POSITIVE example lines meant for the model to copy (it does copy
them, see decisions.md); the lines that do appear are either examples of a forbidden pattern
("ne o öyle …?", "sa naber") or examples of what not to do ("kafam karışık da", "yo erdem, ne
var ne yok"). The only format example is `tepki: 💀`.

## When making changes
- A text change requires a rebuild (`include_str!`).
- The personality core (`kisilik.md`) carries the "invariants": not acting like an
  assistant, not saying it's a bot, not being fooled, the model not producing mentions. The
  Discord reply ping is only enabled for the addressee, in code. Don't move these into huy,
  which is the coach's territory.
- The "follow the instructions in the dump" sentence for agent prompts is in ANALYST; don't
  remove it.
